# Update HP Comware Switches with Ansible

This repository contains an Ansible playbook and an inventory file to update the firmware on HP Comware switches. The playbook is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing you to manage updates for a large number of switches.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the playbook, you need to download/install the following software:

- Ansible (version 2.9 or later)
- HP Comware Firmware image

## Configuration

1. Download the playbook and the inventory file to your Ansible control machine.
2. Update the inventory file with the IP addresses and login credentials for your switches.
3. Copy the firmware image to the Ansible control machine.
4. Update the playbook with the path to the firmware image.

## Execution

To run the playbook, use the following command:

``ansible-playbook update_hp_switches.yml -i switches.ini``


This will execute the playbook and update the firmware on the switches listed in the inventory file. The playbook will also backup the switch configuration and store the backup file in a directory named after the switch hostname.

## Note

- Ensure that you have tested the firmware image before updating the production switches.
- The playbook will pause after the firmware update to wait for the switch to boot before checking the update status.
- Ensure that you have adequate time to run the playbook, as firmware updates can take several minutes to complete.

## Conclusion

By using this Ansible playbook, you can automate the firmware update process on HP Comware switches, saving time and reducing the risk of manual errors. With the flexible and scalable design of the playbook, you can easily manage 
updates for a large number of switches.
